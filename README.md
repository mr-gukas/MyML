# ML and Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my ML (Machine Learning) and DS (Data Science) Portfolio repository!

## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of my work, projects, and assignments related to machine learning and data science. Whether it's personal projects, assignments from courses, or freelance work, you'll find them all here.

## Contents
Here's what you'll find in this repository:

- **Projects:** A directory containing various ML and DS projects I've worked on. Each project has its own folder with detailed documentation.
- **Assignments:** This directory contains assignments from different courses or self-learning endeavors. It's a mix of Jupyter notebooks and code files.
- **Datasets:** Any datasets used in the projects or assignments are stored here. Proper citations and attributions are provided where necessary.
- **Resources:** Additional resources such as research papers, tutorials, or helpful links related to ML and DS.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the projects and assignments. If you find something interesting or have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. You can also use the code or ideas for your own projects, but please adhere to the licenses and give proper credit where due.

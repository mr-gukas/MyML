        "1. Changing the feature values by a constant will not change the distances between them. Therefore, KNN relying only on distances between objects will not change its result.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Similarly. Each pixel is an individual feature. Changing the values of any feature by a constant will not change the distances between features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Changing the values of any feature by a constant will not change the distances between these features. However, if we divide the values of all features by a constant σ, the distance between any two objects will decrease by σ times. This means that the ordering of the features from closest to farthest will not change for any feature. The kNN results will remain the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. When calculating the L1 metric, the distances between objects are summarized for each attribute. At the specified changes, the distances between objects will be reduced by a certain coefficient determined separately for each attribute. This transformation does not guarantee that the order of objects from nearest to farthest will remain unchanged. For example, consider a two-pixel image. One is at (0, 0), the second at (6, 6), the third at (14, 0), and a few more. The variance for the first pixel is 2 and for the second pixel is 1. The second pixel is closer to the first pixel than the third pixel (normalized to L1). However, after transforming the feature vectors, they become (0, 0), (3, 6), (7, 0) respectively. Now the third is closer to the first than the second. The answer in 1-NN has changed. Similarly, the answer in 5-NN can be changed. Thus, the results of the algorithm can change.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When the image is rotated, the rotation of coordinate axes only swaps the signs. At this transformation the value of norm L1 does not change. Consequently, the distances will not change. The work kNN remains unchanged.\n",

        "2. The training error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of 5-NN.\n",
        "3. The test error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of a 5-NN.\n",

        "*Your Explanation:*\n",
        "1. **NO**: The decision boundary of a k-NN classifier is not necessarily linear. It can be highly nonlinear and is determined by the distribution of the training data.\n",
        "2. **YES**: The training error of 1-NNs is usually lower than that of 5-NNs because 1-NNs tend to memorize the training data (which may lead to overfitting).\n",
        "3. **NO**: The test error for 1-NN will not always be lower than that of 5-NN. 1-NC may perform well on training data, but may have higher test error due to overfitting or excessive sensitivity to noise.\n",
        "4. **YES**: The time required to classify a test case using a k-NN classifier increases with the size of the training set because of the computation required to find nearest neighbors.\n",
        "5. **NO**: As stated above, several statements are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The k-NN decision boundary is not necessarily linear, 1-NN usually has smaller training error than 5-NN, but is not guaranteed for testing error. The classification time increases with the size of the training set.\n",
